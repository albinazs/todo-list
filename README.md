Todo app created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, date-fns package, ESLint, Prettier and webpack.
Check out live preview here: https://albinazs.github.io/todo-list/

Functionality:

- add projects
- delete projects
- add tasks into projects
- edit tasks
- mark tasks as completed
- delete tasks
- display all tasks
- display tasks due today
- display tasks due this week
- auto save all content of todo app to local storage
- open & hide side panel on mobile screen

Ideas to improve:

- to add completed tasks view and completed tasks delete all
- to add ascending sort for this week view
- to place todo edit form on top of todo being edited
